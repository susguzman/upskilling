# Docker

## What is docker ?
- Docker lets you **build, test, and deploy** applications quickly.
- Docker is an open source platform for building, deploying, and managing containerized applications. 

## Conceptos

### Contenedor
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

### Image
A container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. **Container images become containers at runtime**.
